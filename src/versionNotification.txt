👏 **Harder**

• Challenge your friends or enjoy solo 🎮 with the full support of game bots like @gamee or @gamebot.
• Know who you can trust – `SCAM` and `FAKE` badges now appear in suspicious chats.
• Report suspicious peers and their profile photos.
• Configure bot extra settings (if available) in the chat via ⋮ > Settings.

🤩 **Better**
