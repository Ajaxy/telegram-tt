**Telegram Web Z was updated to version 1.44**

👏 **Harder**
• Mention and reaction badges are now shown both in the chat list and inside chats – tapping the badge in chat jumps to the relevant message.
• Improved Device Management – with a detailed overview of active sessions and new icons. Tap or click a session in the list to see more info or remotely log it out.
• Privacy Settings now have options for Calls, including Exceptions.
• From other chats, instantly open a 1-on-1 chat with a bot using ‘Open Bot' in the ⋮ menu of the bot's preview window.

🤩 **Better**
• Browser navigation has been rebuilt from scratch – no more freezes or crashes.

💪 **Stronger**
• Fixed an issue where chats could get stuck in the Unread folder.
• The app no longer duplicates text pasted from the clipboard.
• Random media files failing to load should no longer occur.
• Fixed issues when adding a contact with a hidden phone number.
