👏 **Harder**
• Protected Content in Groups and Channels:
  – Content creators can restrict the ability to forward messages from their groups and channels.
  – When forwarding is restricted, users will also be unable to directly save media from the chat or take screenshots.
  – Toggle this option on or off via Chat Info > Group / Channel Type.
• Anonymous Posting in Public Groups
  – Comment as one of your channels in public groups and channel comments.
  – Tap the profile picture next to the message bar to choose which channel you will appear as when you send the message.
• Your peers will now be notified when you are typing a message or selecting a sticker.

🤩 **Better**
