**Telegram Web Z was updated to version 1.47**

👏 **Harder**
• This update adds a Passcode Lock feature, giving Telegram users the most private and secure experience of any web app. To add a passcode, go to Settings > Privacy and Security > Passcode Lock.
• When the app is locked, it encrypts its data, including your chats, text messages, contacts, and your session keys – making it impossible to access them without the code. By adding a passcode, users on shared PCs no longer need to log out to protect their privacy.
• Remember the passcode you set, you will need to log out and back in to your account if you forget it.

🤩 **Better**
• Media Viewer now supports native zoom and pan gestures with a trackpad or Magic Mouse.
• Statistics now include data about Public Shares for posts.
• Improvements and tweaks for Group and Channel Statistics.

🚀 **Faster**
• Optimizations for the rendering engine.

💪 **Stronger**
• Various fixes for code syntax highlighting, including support for C#.
