**Telegram Web Z was updated to version 1.46**

👏 **Harder**
• Web Z becomes the first official app to support code syntax highlighting – start a code block with a language code, and the app will highlight separate terms and functions:
```js
console.log('Hello world!');
```
• Use new buttons to copy code contents and switch word wrapping.
• When available, Group Sticker Sets now appear in the sticker panel.
• Improved Sticker Management – preview sticker sets faster or clear recently sent stickers by right-clicking and selecting ‘View Pack’ or ‘Remove from Recent’.

🤩 **Better**
• Added fresh and modern chat background.
• Various layout improvements.

🚀 **Faster**

• Background should no longer flicker after logging in.
• Fixed closing the forward dialog when switching to inline bots.
• Fixed scrolling in Channel Management > Join Requests.
