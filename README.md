# Telegram Web A

This project won the first prize ðŸ¥‡ at [Telegram Lightweight Client Contest](https://contest.com/javascript-web-3) and now is an official Telegram client available to anyone at [web.telegram.org/a](https://web.telegram.org/a).

According to the original contest rules, it has nearly zero dependencies and is fully based on its own [Teact](https://github.com/Ajaxy/teact) framework (which re-implements React paradigm). It also uses a custom version of [GramJS](https://github.com/gram-js/gramjs) as an MTProto implementation.

The project incorporates lots of technologically advanced features, modern Web APIs and techniques: WebSockets, Web Workers and WebAssembly, multi-level caching and PWA, voice recording and media streaming, cryptography and raw binary data operations, optimistic and progressive interfaces, complicated CSS/Canvas/SVG animations, reactive data streams, and so much more.

Feel free to explore, provide feedback and contribute.

## Local setup

```sh
mv .env.example .env

npm i
```

Obtain API ID and API hash on [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org) and populate the `.env` file.

## Dev mode

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Invoking API from console

Start your dev server and locate GramJS worker in console context.

All constructors and functions available in global `GramJs` variable.

Run `npm run gramjs:tl full` to get access to all available Telegram requests.

Example usage:
``` javascript
await invoke(new GramJs.help.GetAppConfig())
```

## Electron

Electron allows building a native application that can be installed on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

#### NPM scripts

- `npm run dev:electron`

Run Electron in development mode, concurrently starts 3 processes with watch for changes: main (main Electron process), renderer (FE code) and Webpack for Electron (compiles main Electron process from TypeScript).

- `npm run electron:webpack`

The main process code for Electron, which includes preload functionality, is written in TypeScript and is compiled using the `webpack-electron.config.js` configuration to generate JavaScript code.

- `npm run electron:build`

Prepare renderer (FE code) build, compile Electron main process code, install and build native dependencies, is used before packaging or publishing.

- `npm run electron:staging`

Create packages for macOS, Windows and Linux in `dist-electron` folders with `APP_ENV` as `staging` (allows to open DevTools, includes sourcemaps and does not minify built JavaScript code), can be used for manual distribution and testing packaged application.

- `npm run electron:production`

Create packages for macOS, Windows and Linux in `dist-electron` folders with `APP_ENV` as `production` (disabled DevTools, minified built JavaScript code), can be used for manual distribution and testing packaged application.

- `npm run deploy:electron`

Create packages for macOS, Windows and Linux in `dist-electron` folder and publish release to GitHub, which allows supporting autoupdates. See [GitHub release workflow](#github-release) for more info.

#### Code signing on MacOS

To sign the code of your application, follow these steps:

- Install certificates from `/certs` folder to `login` folder of your Keychain.
- Download and install `Developer ID - G2` certificate from the [Apple PKI](https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/) page.
- Under the Keychain application, go to the private key associated with your developer certificate. Then do `key > Get Info > Access Control`. Down there, make sure your application (Xcode) is in the list `Always allow access by these applications` and make sure `Confirm before allowing access` is turned on.
- A valid and appropriate identity from your keychain will be automatically used when you publish your application.

More info in the [official documentation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/code-signing).

#### Notarize on MacOS

Application notarization is done automatically in [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/) module, which requires `APPLE_ID` and `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` environment variables to be passed.

How to obtain app-specific password:

- Sign in to [appleid.apple.com](appleid.apple.com).
- In the "Sign-In and Security" section, select "App-Specific Passwords".
- Select "Generate an app-specific password" or select the Add button, then follow the steps on your screen.

#### GitHub release

##### GitHub access token

In order to publish new release, you need to add GitHub access token to `.env`. Generate a GitHub access token by going to https://github.com/settings/tokens/new. The access token should have the repo scope/permission. Once you have the token, assign it to an environment variable:

```
# .env
GH_TOKEN="{YOUR_TOKEN_HERE}"
```

##### Publish settings

Publish configuration in `src/electron/config.yml` config file allows to set GitHub repository owner/name.

##### Release workflow

- Run `npm run electron:publish`, which will create new draft release and upload build artefacts to newly reated release. Version of created release will be the same as in `package.json`.
- Once you are done, publish the release. GitHub will tag the latest commit.
