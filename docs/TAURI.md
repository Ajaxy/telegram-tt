# Tauri

**Tauri** allows building a native application that can be installed on Windows, macOS and Linux.

Since it's based on native OS WebView, you must compile application separately for each target platform, meaning you cannot build a macOS application on a Windows machine, or vice versa. Each build must be done on its respective platform.

## Installation

To run Tauri locally, ensure that [Rust is installed](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/#rust).

## Upgrading dependencies

- To detect available upgrades for NPM modules, run:

```bash
# Get outdated module
npm outdated @tauri-apps/{MODULE} # e.g. npm outdated @tauri-apps/cli
# or list all available versions
npm view @tauri-apps/{MODULE} versions -json

# Install a specific version
npm install @tauri-apps/cli@{VERSION}
# or install the latest version
npm install @tauri-apps/cli@latest
```

- To upgrade Rust (Cargo) modules, run:

```bash
# Install the cargo-edit module for easier upgrade
cargo install cargo-edit

# Change to the `/tauri` directory
cd tauri

# Run the upgrade
cargo upgrade
```

For details on upgrading Tauri dependencies, refer to the [official documentation](https://tauri.app/develop/updating-dependencies/).

## NPM scripts

- `npm run tauri:dev` — run Tauri in development mode.

- `npm run tauri` — placeholder, which allows you to run [Tauri CLI](https://v2.tauri.app/reference/cli/) commands with `npm run tauri {COMMAND}`.

## Implementation specifics

### Accessing the Tauri API

The Tauri API, including any integrated plugins, is accessible via the `window.tauri` object. For type definitions, refer to the `src/types/tauri.ts` file.

If you have implemented [custom commands](https://tauri.app/develop/calling-rust/), ensure they are properly registered in the `src/util/tauri/initTauriApi.ts`

### Custom header on MacOS

Tauri currently has [some problems](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/13044) with custom titlebar style. Current implementation that uses native window handle would be removed when those problems are fixed.

### Multiple windows support

The Tauri main process exposes the `open_new_window` command, available as `window.tauri.openNewWindow`. This method can be used to open a new "child" closable window:

```typescript
openNewWindow: (url: string) => Promise<void>
```

### Notifications

The Tauri notifications plugin [overrides the default Notification web API](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/blob/v2/plugins/notification/guest-js/init.ts#L56), so no additional function needs to be called to send a notification to the user.

**Important:**

- Clicking on notifications to open the appropriate chat is currently not possible. More details in the [issue](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/issues/1903).

### Browser devtools

Browser DevTools context menu can be enabled by adding the `devtools` feature to the `tauri/Cargo.toml` file:

```rust
[dependencies]
tauri = { version = "...", features = ["...", "devtools"] }
```

For debug builds, DevTools are included by default through the `includeDebug` flag in the GitHub action. [More info](https://tauri.app/develop/debug/#webview-console)

### Capabilities

The `tauri/capabilities` folder provides fine-grained control over application windows and access to Tauri core, application, or plugin commands. These capabilities can be configured for different environments such as `development`, `staging` and `production`.
Keep them at minimum. For complex logic, consider implementing own command in Rust, rather than giving permissions to JS side.

Learn more about [capabilities](https://tauri.app/reference/acl/capability/) and [how to configure them for different windows or platforms](https://tauri.app/learn/security/capabilities-for-windows-and-platforms/).

## Autoupdates

The application's autoupdate cycle is managed using the [Updater](https://tauri.app/plugin/updater/) plugin.

Each time the "Package & Publish" GitHub workflow runs successfully, a new release is created in the publish repository. This release includes build artifacts and a `latest.json` file with a [JSON file](https://tauri.app/plugin/updater/#static-json-file) containing download links for each platform and signature tokens.

The frontend application polls for updates every 10 minutes and displays an "Update" button if an update is available.

**Important**: In development mode and for local builds, autoupdates are not available. Keys and other information are dynamically added within the GitHub action during the `Define Tauri configuration overrides` step.

## GitHub workflow for release

The build and release process for a Tauri application is managed using a GitHub workflow that leverages the official [Tauri Action](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action).
